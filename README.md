# 🤖👨‍💻 Artifical Neural Networks 👨‍💻🤖

## 🏗️ How to setup the code

1. Clone the repository ✌️

2. Download the dataset from this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x1yvXG9iBkUsSYrGL-OPhZpm5PzXMcb-?usp=sharing)

3. Unzip the dataset and move it to root of this repo.

4. Install the requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

The download and unzipping of the datasat is requried, since the file is 500MB and GitHub does not allow files larger than 100MB.

## 🏎️How to run the code

1. move into your folder `cd [your name]`

2. run the code `python3 model.py`

## 📦How to deliver the code

1. After you have created the model when you ran the code, you will have a model inside the `LEVERINGSMAPPE` folder
2. Zip the folder `LEVERINGSMAPPE` and it is now ready to be delivered
